# Jenkins Basics
# 🚀 Introduction to Jenkins

## 🧩 What is Jenkins?
- **Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used to automate parts of the software development process such as **building**, **testing**, and **deploying** applications.  
- It helps developers integrate their changes continuously and deliver updates quickly and reliably.
- Jenkins supports hundreds of plugins to integrate with various tools and services in the software development lifecycle.
## 🤔 Why Use Jenkins?
- In traditional development workflows:
- Developers write code and manually test it.
- Builds and deployments are done by hand.
- Mistakes can occur, and the process is time-consuming.
- With Jenkins, all these steps can be **automated**.

✅ Jenkins automatically:
1. Detects new code changes (e.g., from GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket)
2. Builds and tests the code.
3. Packages and deploys the application.
4. Notifies the team if something fails.

This process is known as **CI/CD**:
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploying those changes to staging or production environments.

##  Example Workflow
- Let’s say your code is hosted on **GitHub**.

### Without Jenkins:
- A developer pushes code to GitHub.
- Someone manually pulls the code.
- Runs build commands.
- Manually deploys it to a test or production server.

This can be **slow** and **error-prone**.

### With Jenkins:
1. Jenkins detects the new GitHub commit.
2. It automatically runs build scripts (e.g., `mvn clean install` or `npm run build`).
3. Runs automated tests.
4. Deploys the app if all tests pass.

This ensures a **faster**, **more reliable**, and **repeatable** development process.


## ⚙️ Example Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)

Here’s a simple example of a Jenkins pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the app...'
                sh 'scp target/app.war user@server:/deploy/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# 🚀 Understanding CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment)

## 🧩 What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

Together, they form a **DevOps pipeline** — an automated process that helps teams deliver software **faster, safer, and more reliably**.

Think of CI/CD as an **automated assembly line** for software:
1. Code is written and committed.
2. It’s automatically built and tested.
3. If successful, it’s deployed to staging or production.

## 🔁 CI vs CD (Key Differences)

| Aspect         | Continuous Integration (CI)                  | Continuous Delivery (CD)                       | Continuous Deployment (CD)                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**       | Merge code frequently and test automatically | Automate release preparation                   | Automate the entire release to production            |
| **Deployment** | Not included                                 | Manual trigger                                 | Fully automatic                                      |
| **Focus**      | Code integration & testing                   | Packaging & staging deployment                 | Full production deployment                           |
| **Risk**       | Detects early bugs                           | Reduces deployment risk                        | Delivers features faster but requires strong testing |
| **Example**    | Jenkins builds + tests code                  | Jenkins builds, tests, and prepares deployment | Jenkins builds, tests, and deploys live              |

       ↓
[Continuous Delivery]
   → Package → Deploy to Staging → Manual Approval

# Example Jenkinsfile for CI/CD
```
pipeline {
agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running automated tests...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Staging Deployment') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to staging environment...'
                sh './deploy-staging.sh'
            }
        }

        stage('Production Deployment') {
            when {
                branch 'main'
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to production automatically...'
                sh './deploy-production.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## Summary
- **Continuous Integration:** Automatically builds and tests code changes to ensure quality.
- **Continuous Delivery:**	Keeps the application in a deployable state and automates release preparation.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automates deployment — code changes go live automatically after passing tests.
