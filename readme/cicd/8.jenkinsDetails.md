# Jenkins Detailed Overview
## 🚀 What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is an open-source automation server used mainly for:
    - CI (Continuous Integration)
    - CD (Continuous Delivery / Deployment)
    - Automating repetitive development tasks
## Think of Jenkins as your automation robot that:
- ☑ builds your app
- ☑ runs tests
- ☑ performs code analysis
- ☑ packages the app
- ☑ deploys it to a server, cloud, or app store
- …all automatically, every time a developer pushes code.
## 🎯 Why is Jenkins used?
- **✔ 1. Automate Builds**
- Every time code changes, Jenkins automatically compiles and builds the project.
- No more manual builds.
- **✔ 2. Run Tests Automatically**
- Unit tests, integration tests, UI tests—Jenkins can run them all.
- **✔ 3. Ensure Code Quality**
- Integrate tools like:
- SonarQube (code analysis)
- ESLint (linting)
- Prettier
- Jest testing
- **✔ 4. Automate Deployments**
- Jenkins can deploy:
- React Native apps ✨
- Android APK to Play Store
- IOS IPA to TestFlight
- Backend APIs to AWS/Heroku/Docker/Kubernetes
- Websites to servers
- **✔ 5. CI/CD Pipelines**
- Jenkins makes sure code is tested, validated, built, and deployed automatically.
## 🧠 CI vs CD — Jenkins Role
## CI (Continuous Integration)
- Developers merge code → Jenkins checks:
- ✔ Does the code compile?
- ✔ Do tests pass?
- ✔ Is code clean?
## CD (Continuous Delivery / Deployment)
- If CI is successful:
- ✔ Build the app
- ✔ Release to staging
- ✔ Deploy to production
## 🔧 What can Jenkins automate?
- Jenkins can automate almost anything:
- Build React Native apps (Android & iOS)
- Build Node.js / Java / Python applications
- Run test suites
- Build Docker images
- Deploy to AWS/Azure/GCP
- Trigger Slack notifications
- Run cron jobs
- Automate Git workflows (merge, release tagging)
## 🏗️ How Jenkins Works (Simple Explanation)
- **Jenkins consists of:**
- 1️⃣ Master Node (Controller)
- Runs the Jenkins UI and manages jobs.
- 2️⃣ Agent Nodes (Workers)
- Machines where builds actually run.
- Used to distribute workload (Android builds → Linux, iOS builds → macOS).
- 3️⃣ Pipelines
- A pipeline defines the automation steps using:
- Jenkins UI
## Jenkinsfile (script)
- 📄 Example Jenkinsfile (Simple React Native Example)
```
pipeline {
agent any

    stages {
        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Android') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew assembleRelease'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## 🔌 Jenkins Plugins
- One reason Jenkins is so powerful is its huge plugin ecosystem:
- Popular plugins include:
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
- Slack Notifications
- Pipeline
- Android signing plugin
- Keychains and certificates (for iOS builds)
- SonarQube scanner
- Blue Ocean UI
- Over 1800+ plugins exist.
