# Continuous Integration (CI)

### 📘 Definition
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of **frequently integrating code changes** from multiple developers into a shared repository (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
- Every time code is pushed, **automated builds and tests** are run to ensure nothing is broken.

### 🧠 Key Goals
- Detect bugs early.
- Avoid “integration hell” (where merging code becomes a nightmare).
- Ensure new code works well with the existing codebase.

### ⚡ Example
1. Developer A and Developer B both work on different features.
2. They push their code to GitHub.
3. Jenkins (or another CI tool) automatically:
    - Pulls the latest code.
    - Builds the application.
    - Runs unit tests.

- If everything passes ✅, Jenkins marks the build as **successful**.
- If something fails ❌, the team gets notified to fix the issue immediately.

### 🧰 Tools Used for CI
