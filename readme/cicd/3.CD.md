# 🚀 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)

### 📘 Definition
- **Continuous Delivery** ensures that the application is **always in a deployable state** after passing all automated tests.
- Deployment to production is **manual**, but all other steps (build, test, package) are automated.

In other words:
> The code is automatically tested and prepared for release, but a human decides **when to deploy**.

### 🧠 Key Goals
- Make deployments predictable and low-risk.
- Keep software always ready for release.
- Allow faster, safer updates.

### ⚡ Example
1. After CI runs successfully:
    - Jenkins packages the code (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, `.zip`, Docker image).
    - It deploys automatically to a **staging/test environment**.
2. A manager or DevOps engineer clicks a button in Jenkins to deploy to **production**.

- So, deployment is just **one click away** — not fully automatic.

### 🧰 Tools for Continuous Delivery
- Jenkins
- Spinnaker
- AWS CodePipeline
- GitLab CI/CD
- Azure DevOps

## 🌐 3. Continuous Deployment (CD)

### 📘 Definition
- **Continuous Deployment** takes Continuous Delivery **one step further** — it **automatically deploys** every successful change **directly to production** without any manual approval.

In other words:
> Every time code passes all tests, it goes live automatically.

### 🧠 Key Goals
- Deliver updates to users instantly.
- Fully automate the release process.
- Shorten the feedback loop between development and users.

### ⚡ Example
1. Developer pushes new code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins automatically:
    - Builds the code.
    - Runs all tests.
    - Deploys to staging.
    - Deploys to **production** automatically (if all tests pass).

🎉 Users see the new feature within minutes — no human intervention required.

### 🧰 Tools for Continuous Deployment
